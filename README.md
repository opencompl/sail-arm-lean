# ARM ISA Semantics for Lean (arm-v9.4-a)

These semantics are generated from the official ARM SPEC available at
https://github.com/rems-project/sail-arm.

⚠️ While this repository covers the full ARM, our Lean backend for sail
is still work-in-progress. As a result, our semantics are still full of warnings
and errors. Similarly, our output is not yet polished for readability.
